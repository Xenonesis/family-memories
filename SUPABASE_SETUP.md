```

### 2. **Authentication Setup**
In Supabase Dashboard â†’ Authentication â†’ Settings:
- Enable email confirmations
- Set site URL to your domain
- Configure email templates

### 3. **Storage Setup**
The storage bucket is created automatically by the SQL script.
Verify in Supabase Dashboard â†’ Storage that the 'photos' bucket exists.

### 4. **Environment Variables**
Your `.env.local` file is already configured with:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://mwzalxctdbpnourkyjcp.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Features Included

### âœ… **Core Features**
- User authentication with email verification
- Vault creation and management
- Photo upload with metadata
- Real-time data fetching
- Row Level Security (RLS)

### âœ… **Advanced Features**
- Invitation system for vault members
- Photo comments (legacy notes)
- Democratic photo deletion voting
- Performance optimized with indexes
- Automatic timestamp updates

### âœ… **Security Features**
- Row Level Security on all tables
- User can only access their vaults
- Secure file upload with user-based folders

## ðŸš€ **Ready to Use**
After running the SQL script, your application will:
1. Show only real data from Supabase
2. Handle user authentication
3. Create and manage vaults
4. Upload and display photos
5. Maintain secure access control

The application is now production-ready with a complete database schema!
